T::{method} refers to node-term-ui::{method} 

##wtf why is it not always centering the text... beyond that why is it showing escape characters?
Aww because T::pos was not handling floats which I had not yet encountered do to lack of built in centering. 
Solution? Math.floor in the T::pos

##on centering
I am realizing I am using centering often enough that it should be in T itself. 

##box scrolling bug
apparently there is a bug in scrolling letting the scroll bar go higher than it should.
